Browser bridge module for handling communication between server and AIDA widget.

This module provides:
- send_browser_tool_call: Send a tool call request to the browser (Socket.IO + Redis queue)
- wait_for_browser_response: Block for the browser's response, budgeting each phase
- submit_browser_tool_result: API endpoint for browser to submit results
- submit_browser_tool_ack: API endpoint for the browser to report progress, which is
  what lets the wait distinguish "widget absent" from "user still deciding"
- get_pending_browser_tool_calls: API for widget to catch up on missed calls after navigation

See the budget model below — the single flat timeout this replaced is why
screenshots failed while their approval card was still on screen.

# A browser tool call is NOT a uniform RPC. It has three phases with wildly

# the approval card, so every capture-speed fix was invisible.
#
#   1. delivery   — socket hop. Milliseconds. If the widget does not acknowledge
#                   within ACK_TIMEOUT it is not listening, and waiting the full
#                   execution budget just to say so is wasted worker time.
#   2. decision   — a human reading an approval card. Unbounded in principle;
#                   USER_DECISION_TIMEOUT is what we are willing to hold for.
#   3. execution  — the actual capture/DOM work, budgeted per tool via
#                   BaseBrowserTool._timeout.
