    This tool captures the page, uploads it as a Frappe File, and returns
    the screenshot image directly for vision analysis. The AI can see
    and analyze the screenshot without needing OCR.

    Use this when:
    - Debugging visual/layout issues
    - Verifying chart or dashboard appearance
    - When user reports "something looks wrong"
    - Understanding complex visual layouts

    Note: for error reports, prefer browser_capture_diagnostics — it also
