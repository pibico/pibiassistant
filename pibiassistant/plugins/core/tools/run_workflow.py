    """
    Comprehensive workflow tool that properly leverages Frappe's workflow system.

    This tool:
    1. Uses Frappe's native workflow API correctly
    2. Handles all workflow side effects (document status, emails, etc.)
    3. Provides clear feedback about what happened
    4. Shows available transitions when actions fail

    WHEN TO USE:
    - User wants to "submit", "approve", "reject", or perform any workflow action
    - Document has a workflow configured (Sales Order, Purchase Order, etc.)
    - Need to trigger business process automation
    - Want proper notifications and permissions to be enforced

    WHEN NOT TO USE:
    - Simple field updates (use update_document instead)
    - Document has no workflow configured
    - Direct workflow_state manipulation (this bypasses business logic)

    EXAMPLES:
    - Submit a Sales Order: {"doctype": "Sales Order", "name": "SO-001", "action": "Submit"}
    - Approve a Purchase Order: {"doctype": "Purchase Order", "name": "PO-001", "action": "Approve"}
    - Reject a Leave Application: {"doctype": "Leave Application", "name": "LA-001", "action": "Reject"}
