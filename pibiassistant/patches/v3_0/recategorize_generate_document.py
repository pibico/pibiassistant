Re-categorize generate_document from read_only to write.

generate_document was hardcoded as read_only on the reasoning "renders markdown,
changes no Frappe records". But it SAVES a private Frappe File — a create side
effect — so its MCP annotation was wrongly ``readOnlyHint: true``. That let it
leak into read-only-only contexts (notably the delegate helper's write-free
toolset), where a delegated subtask could generate a document unasked.

The detector now classifies it as ``write``. Existing PA Tool Configuration rows
were seeded with the old value, so re-detect for every row the admin has NOT
explicitly overridden (``category_override = 0``) and update both ``tool_category``
and ``auto_detected_category``. Deliberate admin overrides are left untouched.
