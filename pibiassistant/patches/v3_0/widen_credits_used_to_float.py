Widen PA Chat Message.credits_used from Int to Float and backfill fractions.

Credits are fractional (a cheap turn can cost 0.4 credits), but the column was
Int, so every sub-1.0 turn stored as 0 and the Usage page under-reported totals.
The doctype JSON is now Float; reload it so the column widens even on a
schema-only migrate.

Historical single-model rows already lost their fractions on the original Int
write — unrecoverable, left as-is (non-destructive). Multi-model (delegating)
turns kept exact per-model floats in the ``model_breakdown`` JSON, so for those
rows we recompute ``credits_used`` as the sum of those floats — recovering the
precision the Int column had discarded.
