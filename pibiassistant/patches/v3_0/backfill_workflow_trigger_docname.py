"""Backfill PA Workflow Trigger.workflow_docname from the cloud.

Existing triggers store only the workflow's MUTABLE display name, which AR
resolves by {workflow_name, tenant, status: "Active"} — so renaming an agent in
the builder silently killed every trigger bound to it. This resolves each row's
display name to the AR docname once, and the dispatcher prefers that from then
on.

Best-effort by design: a site that is not registered, or whose cloud is
unreachable during migrate, keeps the empty field and keeps using the legacy
human-name lookup. Re-running the patch fills in what it missed.
