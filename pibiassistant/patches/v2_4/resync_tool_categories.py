"""
Re-sync auto-detected tool categories from the detector.

Several tools (get_pending_approvals, the browser_* tools, generate_document,
send_email) were seeded into PA Tool Configuration before they had hardcoded
categories, so they defaulted to ``read_write`` and were treated as write tools
(``readOnlyHint: false``) — making the assistant prompt for read-only actions
like reading the approval queue or capturing a screenshot.

This patch re-detects the category for every row the admin has NOT explicitly
overridden (``category_override = 0``) and updates both ``tool_category`` and
``auto_detected_category`` to the current detector value. Rows with a deliberate
admin override are left untouched.
