/**
 * Routing copy for the Desk widget.
 *
 * The map literals are generated from the SPA's components/chat/routingCopy.js:
 * the widget is browser-global JS and cannot import the SPA bundle, so the
 * delivery is duplicated. widgetRouting.spec.js asserts the two are identical
 * in keys and values, so the wording cannot drift even though the file does.
 *
 * Widget disclosure is L0 + L1 only — chip and tooltip, no panel.
