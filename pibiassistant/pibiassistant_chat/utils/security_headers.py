"""
Security headers for the pibiAssistant AIDA SPA.

Applies CSP, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy to the ``/aida`` SPA
routes only. Desk (``/app/*``) and API (``/api/method/*``) responses are
NOT touched — those surfaces have their own policies managed by Frappe.

The policy is intentionally conservative:
    - ``frame-ancestors 'self'`` and ``X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN``
      mitigate clickjacking of the HITL approval UI.
    - ``Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`` prevents
      leaking query-string secrets (e.g. ``session_id``) to third parties.
    - ``script-src`` still allows ``'unsafe-inline'`` because the SPA
      hydrates via an inline ``<script>`` in ``aida.html``. A follow-up
      must replace that with a nonce + tightened policy.

Headers are written to ``frappe.local.response_headers`` (a werkzeug
``Headers`` instance) which Frappe's request pipeline merges into the
final response in ``frappe/app.py``. This works transparently for both
cached and freshly-rendered pages.

# Kept as a single-line string so HTTP middleware doesn't choke on newlines.

# Google Fonts is allow-listed in style-src / font-src because the SPA's
# theme.css imports Work Sans via @import from fonts.googleapis.com. Any
# follow-up that self-hosts the font file can tighten this back to 'self'.
#
# No gateway is allow-listed here any more. Payments are collected on PA
# Cloud's own site — a gateway is onboarded against one declared website and
# this app runs on a different customer domain every time — so nothing here
# loads a checkout script or iframes a card form. Leaving the hosts listed
# would keep a door open that nothing walks through.
#
# The redirect out is a top-level navigation, which no directive here
# governs: `form-action` restricts form submissions, not `window.location`,
# and `navigate-to` is not set. Stripe keeps its frame hosts because the
# Customer Portal is still opened directly from billing settings.
