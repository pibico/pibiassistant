"""Which AR server this site talks to.

`pa_cloud_url` is environment identity, not a user preference: `tenant_id` and
`tenant_secret` are issued by whichever server it names, so repointing a
registered site silently invalidates them. It therefore resolves from
site_config — per-site, outside git, already managed by devops — with
production compiled in as the fallback:

    bench --site demo.pibico.es set-config pa_cloud_url https://api.pibico.es
    bench --site dev.localhost   set-config pa_cloud_url http://localhost:8001

The PA Chat Settings field of the same name is a read-only mirror of this,
refreshed on migrate so Desk and the SPA can show where the site points.
