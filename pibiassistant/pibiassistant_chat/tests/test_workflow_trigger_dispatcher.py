"""Tests for the wildcard doc_events dispatcher's guard ordering.

The dispatcher fires on every doc save site-wide (``doc_events = {"*": ...}``),
including the DocType saves Frappe performs during ``bench migrate``. It must
check the migrate/install/patch flags BEFORE reading the PA Chat gate —
otherwise, when upgrading from a build that predates ``enable_pa_chat``, the
gate read raises mid-migration and crashes every doc save.
