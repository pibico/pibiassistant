"""_persist_resume_cycle backs both the resume funnel's stream_complete
persistence and its Stop-mid-resume abort path. full_response passed
into it only ever holds the CURRENT resume cycle's text — one logical
turn can span several resume cycles. It must therefore APPEND to
whatever the row already holds rather than replacing it, and must not
clobber a row a concurrent cancel_stream already marked ``aborted``.

Before this helper existed, the abort branch called the send funnel's
_handle_stream_aborted -> _persist_partial_assistant_turn, which writes
``content = partial_response`` outright (see
test_relay_partial_persistence.py's own assertion that that helper
replaces, by design, for the send funnel where full_response holds the
whole turn). Reusing it here silently discarded everything earlier
resume cycles had already persisted, and skipped the aborted guard the
completion path has, letting it race a concurrent HITL-abort write from
cancel.py.
