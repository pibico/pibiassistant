"""Structural pin for the Redis cancel-flag regression: moving the flag
from a process-local set to frappe.cache() made a stale flag poison
EVERY gunicorn worker for the full 120s TTL, unless both relay funnels
clear it before touching a new turn's events. That fix is an omission
bug by nature — nothing at runtime distinguishes "clears at the top"
from "doesn't", so only a source-level check catches a future edit that
silently drops the call.

Also pins which finalizer each funnel's TWO cancellation branches call —
the local `if is_cancelled(session_id):` poll and the `elif event_type
== "stream_cancelled":` branch that reacts to AR's own authoritative
cancel confirmation. The send funnel's `full_response` holds the whole
turn, so its branches must call `_handle_stream_aborted` (replace
semantics). The resume funnel's `full_response` holds only the current
resume cycle, so its branches must call `_persist_resume_cycle` (append
semantics) and never `_handle_stream_aborted` — using the replace helper
there would erase every earlier resume cycle's text. Each branch gets
its own scoped assertion (not a whole-function scan) so a mutation in
one branch can't hide behind a correct call in the other.

Uses AST rather than substring position (inspect.getsource + assertIn,
the pattern in test_relay_event_passthrough.py / test_relay_workflow_
created.py) because ordering matters here, not just presence, and
substring position is brittle under reformatting.
