"""Structural pin for `credits_used` on the `stream_complete` payload.

The header credit meter scopes itself to whichever allowance governs the
caller: a member with an individual cap is metered against that cap, not
against the team pool. `quota_used`/`quota_total` on this event are
tenant-wide, so they cannot move a capped member's meter — only this
turn's own cost can. Without `credits_used` on the wire, a capped member's
meter freezes for the whole session and only corrects on a page reload.

`useStreaming.js` already reads `data.credits_used` off this event, so
until it is emitted that read silently resolves to `undefined`.

Pinned by AST (same idiom as test_relay_stream_cancelled.py) so the
assertion survives reformatting and targets the completion payload
specifically, rather than any dict that happens to mention credits.
