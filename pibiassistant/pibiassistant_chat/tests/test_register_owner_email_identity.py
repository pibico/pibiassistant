"""`owner_email` is resolved, not assumed to already be an address.

A Frappe User's docname is its email for ordinary staff but not for
Administrator — the account most likely to be registering a site. Supplying
`frappe.session.user` used to *defeat* the recovery path rather than use it,
because a truthy non-address skipped the lookup and failed validation.
