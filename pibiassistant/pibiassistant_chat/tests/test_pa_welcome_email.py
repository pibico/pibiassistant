"""The install welcome email must be AIDA onboarding, not the OSS one.

Also guards the defect this file was rewritten for: PA runs on the
customer's own site, `assistant_runtime` (the SaaS server) runs on a separate
deployment, and PA never depends on `assistant_runtime`. Nothing
under the `pibiassistant` package may import `assistant_runtime` at
module scope, or a real customer install ImportErrors — and since this exact
email used to be sent from an install hook, it would fail the install itself.

The guard covers test modules too. It did not until 3.0, and two chat tests
duly imported AR's test base: locally they passed, because AR happens to be
installed on the development bench, while CI could not so much as discover
the suite.
