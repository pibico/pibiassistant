"""Tests for _ar_user_id() — the email-keyed identity PA sends to AR.

AR keys AR Tenant Users by email. For ordinary staff the Frappe username IS
their email, so normalization is a pass-through; the case that matters is the
Administrator account, whose username ("Administrator") is not an email but
whose User record carries the owner's email. That account must resolve to its
email so the owner is recognized as the tenant owner on AR.
