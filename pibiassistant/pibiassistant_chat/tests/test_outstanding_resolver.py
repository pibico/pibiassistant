"""One resolver answers "does this tenant owe money" for every surface.

The amount used to be reachable only through `get_payment_instrument`, called
when the Payment Method tab mounts — so the hero, the sidebar, the invoice list
and the Users page each had to either re-fetch it or invent their own signal.
The signal they could already see, `payment_status == "past_due"`, does not
agree with it: a stalled renewal freezes the cycle without necessarily marking
the subscription past due.
