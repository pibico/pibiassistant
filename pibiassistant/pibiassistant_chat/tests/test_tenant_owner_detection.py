"""Tests for _is_tenant_owner() — recognizing the AIDA tenant owner.

The owner must be able to self-connect before any seat exists (a chicken-and-egg
otherwise: membership is created by the very call the guard blocks). AR is the
source of truth for who the owner is; PA learns it from get_tenant_info and
compares against the user's AR identity (email).
