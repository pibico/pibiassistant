"""Structural pin for the `stream_cancelled` SSE event — AR's authoritative
confirmation that an agent stopped because it was cancelled (as opposed to
the relay's own poll-based `is_cancelled` detection, which fires before AR
has said anything). Both relay funnels must treat it as a terminal abort,
not as `stream_complete`.

The two funnels finalize an abort differently (see test_relay_cancel_
structure.py's docstring for the full rationale), so this event must be
wired through each funnel's OWN existing abort path:

  * send funnel (_relay_ar_stream): `_handle_stream_aborted`, which
    replaces the row's content wholesale — correct there because its
    `full_response` holds the entire turn.
  * resume funnel (_relay_ar_interrupt_resume): `_persist_resume_cycle`
    (append + aborted guard), NEVER `_handle_stream_aborted` — the resume
    funnel's `full_response` holds only the current resume cycle's text,
    and replacing would erase everything earlier cycles wrote. This is
    the same regression test_relay_cancel_structure.py pins for the local
    is_cancelled branch; a `stream_cancelled` branch that called the wrong
    helper would reintroduce it just for a different trigger.

Uses AST rather than substring position (same idiom as
test_relay_cancel_structure.py) so the assertions survive reformatting and
target the `stream_cancelled` branch specifically, not any other branch
that happens to call these helpers elsewhere in the function.
