"""Regression: the SPA boot payload and the sidebar refetch must agree.

The bug: ``initialize_spa`` built its ``sessions`` block from ``_fetch_sessions``,
a private COPY of ``get_user_sessions`` that had drifted — it never applied the
``is_archived = 0`` filter. So a page load hydrated the sidebar with archived
conversations, and the very next in-app navigation (Usage → Chat) remounted
ChatView, refetched via ``get_user_sessions``, and replaced the list with the
correctly-filtered one. With every conversation archived the sidebar went empty
on navigation and came back on refresh.

Same failure mode as ``test_initialize_spa_access`` — a stale copy of an
endpoint diverging from the endpoint. These tests pin the boot path to the one
authoritative implementation so the two can never disagree again.
