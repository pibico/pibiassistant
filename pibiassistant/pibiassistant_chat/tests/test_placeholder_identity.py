"""`admin@example.com` is not an identity — it is Frappe's install fixture.

`frappe/utils/install.py` stamps `User("Administrator").email` with
`admin@example.com` on every site, and `bench new-site` has no flag to change
it. So on essentially every customer site the Administrator account carries a
placeholder address that no one can receive mail at (example.com is reserved by
RFC 2606).

`_ar_user_id` faithfully returned it, and PA then registered the tenant owner
on AR under that address: production's only tenant has
`owner_user_id = "admin@example.com"` beside a real, verified
`owner_email = "hari.madhavan@promantia.com"`.

Nothing is hardcoded here — the value is Frappe's, and the defect is that a
shared placeholder became a durable identity. The moment anyone gives
Administrator a real address, `_ar_user_id` returns something new: PA creates
a *second* AR Tenant User (a second billed seat), the placeholder seat stays
Active as an orphan, and `_is_tenant_owner` stops matching — locking the real
owner out of their own tenant.
