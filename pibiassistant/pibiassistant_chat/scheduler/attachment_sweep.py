"""Daily job. Chat composer uploads happen on file *selection*, not on send, so
a user who attaches a file and then closes the tab leaves a private File behind
that no message and no retention policy will ever reach.

`upload_message_file` marks every such upload with `pa_pending_chat_attachment`;
`send_message` clears the flag when it links the file to a PA Chat Message.
Anything still flagged after 24h was never sent, so it is deleted.

Idempotent; per-file delete errors are swallowed so one bad file cannot wedge
the batch.
