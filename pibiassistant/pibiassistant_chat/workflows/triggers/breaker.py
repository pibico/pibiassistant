"""Trigger loop circuit breaker.

The static DocType blocklist cannot see the loop that actually happens in
production: an agent node calls ``update_document`` on the customer's own MCP
server, that ends in a bare ``doc.save()``, and the save re-enters
``on_update``. So the first workflow anyone builds — "on Sales Order update,
summarize and write it back" — bills a full run per lap until a rate limit
stops it. This bounds one (trigger, document) pair to N fires per window and
refuses the rest.

Counting is a raw Redis ``INCR`` on a site-namespaced key, so concurrent
workers share one counter. It deliberately does not go through
``set_value``/``get_value``: those pickle their payload and read-modify-write
would lose laps under concurrency.

Both limits are per-site overridable in ``site_config.json`` via
``pa_trigger_breaker_max_fires`` and ``pa_trigger_breaker_window_seconds``.
Setting the former to 0 disables the breaker.
