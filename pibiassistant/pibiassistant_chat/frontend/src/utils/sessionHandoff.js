/**
 * Session hand-off between the SPA and the desk widget.
 *
 * The two pass a session id through sessionStorage. That storage survives a
 * logout and is cloned into duplicated tabs, and a session id names no user of
 * its own — so an id stored by one user could be picked up and continued by the
 * next person to log in. Every stored id therefore carries the user who minted
 * it, and is only ever handed back to that same user.
 *
 * The widget half of this shape lives in public/chat/widget/widget_session.js
 * (PAOWidgetSession.encode / decode); the two must stay byte-compatible.
