/**
 * The widget and the SPA answer the same question — "may this person finish
 * their own setup?" — and they used to answer it differently. The SPA asks
 * whether you hold a seat (`isAdmin || isPendingMember`); the widget asked
 * whether you hold the System Manager role. An invited member without that
 * role was told "your administrator hasn't added you to AIDA yet" by the
 * widget, with no button, while the very same click through the Desk
 * notification opened the SPA's working "Connect your account" screen.
 *
 * `needs_setup` is only ever reached when `can_use` is true, and `can_use` IS
 * the membership check — so by the time we render that screen the person is a
 * seated member by construction. Site registration is the one step here that
 * genuinely belongs to an admin.
