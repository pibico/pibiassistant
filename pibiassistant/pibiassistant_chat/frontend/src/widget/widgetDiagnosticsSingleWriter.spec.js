/**
 * Regression guard for a bug that actually shipped: PAODiagnostics.setEnabled
 * once had two writers — one in init() reading check_access()'s response, one
 * in load_widget_settings() reading get_widget_settings()'s response. Both
 * endpoints' documented exception-fallback shapes omit the field they'd need
 * to agree, so whichever call happened to run second silently won — on the
 * exact scenario that matters (operator turns diagnostics off, then
 * get_widget_settings() hits its except-fallback), the second writer
 * re-enabled and re-persisted "on" over a correct "off".
 *
 * The fix is structural (delete the second writer), so the guard is
 * structural too: a source scan, not an execution test — mounting the whole
 * PAOWidget class to prove a deleted code path stays deleted is more
 * machinery than the invariant needs.
