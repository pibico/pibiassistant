"""PA Chat Session State — the single client-held session blob per session.

Zero-retention conversations: AR keeps nothing in its DB; the only copy of
conversation state lives in this row as an opaque, signed, gzipped blob. PA
stores and round-trips it but NEVER parses it (``state_blob`` / ``state_sig``
are handled opaquely). The blob is deleted together with its messages — there
is no separate TTL — by ``archive_session``, ``archive_all_conversations`` and
the retention scheduler, so it can never outlive the conversation it belongs to.
