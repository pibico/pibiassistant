    Relay SSE stream from AR to frontend via Socket.IO.

    This runs in a background thread. It:
    1. Connects to AR stream_chat endpoint
    2. Iterates over SSE events
    3. Emits each event via frappe.publish_realtime
    4. Saves the assistant response to AIDA Message on completion

    Args:
            session_id: Conversation session ID
            full_prompt: Prepared prompt with context
            original_message: Original user message
            context: Page context dict
            message_name: AIDA Message document name
            user: Frappe user
            site: Frappe site
            model_id: Optional model ID for per-request model selection
            attachments: Optional list of attachments for Vision API
            system_prompt_addendum: Optional per-request addition to the system prompt
            session_state: Optional client-held signed session blob (zero-retention).
                    Passed to AR on the request; the updated blob comes back on
                    stream_complete and is persisted into PA Chat Session State.
            restricted: GDPR Article 18 processing restriction (AIDA-M15). When set,
                    no blob is loaded or stored — the turn runs but nothing persists.
            continue_from_message_id: When set, this is a continuation of a
                    previously truncated response rather than a new message — AR
                    is asked to pick up generation from that message. No new user
                    message is pushed; the existing assistant row for that message_id
                    is found and appended to via the same find-or-update-by-message_id
                    persistence stream_complete already uses.
            web_search: Optional composer toggle forwarded to AR. None means
                    "unspecified" (AR defaults to search available); an explicit
                    False turns it off.
            thinking_enabled: Optional composer toggle forwarded to AR. Same
                    None-vs-False semantics as web_search.

    Three things happen here, in order:

    1. Close the SDK iterator. ``stream_chat`` is a generator over an
       HTTP/SSE response; calling ``.close()`` drops the connection,
       which is the signal AR uses to tear down its agent loop. Without
       this, the agent keeps running on the backend and we keep paying
       for tokens we'll never show.
    2. Save the partial assistant turn with ``aborted=1``, the "(Stopped
       by user)" marker appended. The blocks snapshot already reflects
       everything received up to this point, so a reload will render the
       truncated answer correctly rather than vanishing or appearing
       "still streaming".
    3. Emit ``stream_aborted`` so the streamManager on the SPA can
       flip ``isStreaming=false``, clear its activity timeout, and
       render the "(Stopped by user)" tail.
