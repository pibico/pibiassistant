"""Cooperative cancellation of in-flight AR streams.

When the user clicks Stop, the SPA hits :func:`cancel_stream`, which
records the cancellation against ``session_id``. The background relay
in :mod:`api.chat.relay` polls :func:`is_cancelled` between SSE events
and, on a positive hit, closes the SDK iterator (dropping the SSE
connection to AR), persists the partial response with ``aborted=1``,
and emits a final ``stream_aborted`` socket event so the SPA can stop
its activity timeout and mark the message.

Storage is ``frappe.cache()`` (Redis), not a module-level set: cancels
must be visible to whichever gunicorn worker is running the relay loop,
which may not be the worker that received this POST.

    1. **Live relay.** A relay loop is iterating ``stream_chat`` right

       iteration and runs the proper abort handler (closes the SDK
       iterator, persists ``aborted=1``, emits ``stream_aborted``).

    2. **HITL pause.** AR emitted ``approval_required`` followed by
       ``stream_complete interrupted=true`` — at that point the relay
       thread exited cleanly and nothing is iterating anything. The
       persisted assistant row has ``pending`` interaction blocks
       waiting for a future ``resume_interrupt`` request. Pressing Stop
       here has no relay to signal; we mark the row aborted ourselves
