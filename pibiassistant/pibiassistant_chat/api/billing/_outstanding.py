"""One answer to "does this tenant owe money", for every surface that asks.

The figure used to be reachable only through ``get_payment_instrument``, which
the SPA calls when the Payment Method tab mounts. So the billing hero, the
sidebar, the invoice list and the Users page could not show it without a second
round-trip and a second opinion about what "owing" means — and the one signal
they *could* already see, ``payment_status == "past_due"``, disagrees with it: a
stalled renewal freezes the cycle without necessarily marking the subscription
past due, which is exactly the state the notice needs to explain.

Both payloads that hydrate a surface call this, so the four cannot drift apart.

    Never raises. Every caller runs this inside a parallel fan-out that
    assembles a whole page, and a billing lookup that fails must cost the
    outstanding notice, not the page around it.

    AR derives ``amount_due`` from ``owed_invoice()`` — the same narrowing that
    ``update_payment_method`` settles through — so the figure shown here is the
    figure the pay button actually charges. Stripe subscriptions are managed in
    the customer portal and AR returns no ``amount_due`` for them, so nothing is
