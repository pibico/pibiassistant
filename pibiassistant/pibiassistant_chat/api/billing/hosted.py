"""Ask the cloud service for a link to the page where a purchase is paid for.

Payments are not taken on this site. A payment gateway is onboarded against
one declared website, and this app runs on a different domain for every
customer — so the gateway widget belongs on the cloud service.s own public site, not
here. This endpoint swaps a purchase intent for a one-shot link to it.
