    Get current quota status for widget and billing page display.

    Fetches live data from AR to avoid stale cache issues (e.g., after
    a plan upgrade). Falls back to cached AIDA Settings if AR is unreachable.

    This is NOT admin-only - all users can see their organization's quota.

    clients must gate on them rather than on ``percentage_used``, which
    measures the monthly quota alone and so reads as blocked for any tenant
    running on purchased credits.
