"""Helpers for wrapping LLM-bound data from untrusted origin.

Content fetched from user-controlled sources (file attachments, archived
conversation transcripts, scraped web pages, etc.) must never be treated
by the LLM as instructions. This module builds a tagged envelope that
instructs the model to treat the wrapped content as data only.

See security note (prompt injection via file attachments) and security policy
(prior-conversation injection).

    Instructs the LLM to treat everything between the envelope tags as
    data only, never as instructions or commands. The close tag is
    defensively escaped inside the payload to block envelope-break
    attempts like literal ``</user_attached_files>`` text within the
