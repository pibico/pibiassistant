    Register site with AR (tenant registration only).

    With per-user MCP server architecture, OAuth tokens are no longer required
    at tenant registration. Each user will register separately and add their
    own MCP servers with personal OAuth tokens via connect_aida_mcp_server().

    For new registrations AR sends a verification email to owner_email before
    issuing the tenant_secret. The SPA polls complete_email_verification() after
    the admin clicks the link. Re-registrations of an existing tenant return the
    secret immediately (legacy path).

    Two different identities are in play and must not be conflated:

    * ``owner_email`` is a MAILBOX — where AR sends the verification link, and
      later the billing and rebind notices. It may be a shared address and need
      not be anyone's login. The admin types it.
    * ``accepted_by`` becomes AR's ``owner_user_id``, an IDENTITY — who bypasses
      the seat gate and who may add users. Both gates match it against
      ``_ar_user_id(frappe.session.user)``, so it is derived from the session,
      never accepted from the caller.

    Args:
            owner_email: Mailbox the verification link is sent to. Required for
                new registrations; a re-registration keeps the stored one.
