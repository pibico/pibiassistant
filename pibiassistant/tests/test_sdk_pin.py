"""PA must never call an SDK symbol absent from the version PA pins.

This is a pure file/attribute read — no database, no Frappe context — so it is
plain unittest, not FrappeTestCase.

What it does catch: a forgotten pin bump, a `>=` floor sneaking back in, and a
connect method PA's proxy calls that the installed SDK does not define.

What it CANNOT catch: whether 1.9.0 is actually on PyPI. In local dev the SDK
is installed editable (`pip install -e apps/assistant_runtime_sdk`), so this
test reads the source tree, not the published artifact. Only a clean-venv
install of the pinned version proves publication.
